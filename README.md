# nem2-e2e-tests

Integration and e2e tests for the catapult project.

## Prerequisites

* [Java 8](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/install_overview.html)
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/nemtech/nem2-e2e-tests.git
```

2. Install the [Cucumber-JVM](https://docs.cucumber.io/installation/java/). You can install the [Cucumber plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7212-cucumber-for-java) for IntelliJ if you want to run the test from the IDE.

3. Get the latest [catapult-service-bootstrap](https://github.com/tech-bureau/catapult-service-bootstrap) and start the service.

4. Update the following properties under the ``integrationtests/src/test/resources/configs/config-default.properties`` file to match your bootstrap environment.
    - ``apiServerPublicKey``: Public key of the API server. You can find it in ``build/catapult-config/api-node-0/userconfig/resources/peers-api.json``.
    - ``userPrivateKey``: Private key of the user which will be use to sign each transaction. You can find a list of users in ``build/generated-addresses/addresses.yaml`` file under the ``nemesis_addresses`` section.
    - ``mosaicId``: Network currency mosaic identifier. You can find the network mosaic id going to ``http://localhost:3000/#/account/<public_key_of_the_user>``

### Adding new tests

The file structure of the automation tests is as follows:

* Feature files: ``integrationtests/src/test/resources/io/nem``.
* Cucumber steps files: ``integrationtests/src/test/java/io/nem/automation``.

In each of these folders, there is an example folder which has a feature and cucumber steps file respectively.
  
Before adding tests, check the [nem2-scenarios repository](https://github.com/nemtech/nem2-scenarios) for a list of Cucumber feature files already defined. This repository gathers the set of scenarios that should be automated.

To check if a feature file from the nem2 scenarios is already automated, check if the feature file is present in this repository.
