Feature: Edit a multisignature contract
  As Alice,
  I want to edit a multisignature contract,
  so that I have multi-factor authentication up-to-date.

    Given the maximum number of cosignatories per multisignature contract is 10
    And the maximum number of multisignature contracts an account can be cosignatory of is 5
    And  multisignature contracts created have set the minimum number of cosignatures to remove a cosignatory to 1

  Scenario: A cosignatory adds another cosignatory to the multisignature contract
    Given Alice created a 1 of 2 multisignature contract called "tom" with 1 required for removal with cosignatories:
      | cosignatory |
      | computer    |
      | phone       |
    And "computer" update the cosignatories of the multisignature:
      | cosignatory | operation |
      | tablet      | add       |
    And computer published the bonded contract
    When "tablet" accepts the transaction
    Then Alice should receive a confirmation message
    And the multisignature contract should be updated
