Feature: Create an escrow contract
  As Alice,
  I want to create an escrow contract between different participants,
  so that there is no need to trust in each other.


    Given the native currency asset is "cat.currency"
    And the maximum number of participants per escrow contract is 15
    And the maximum number of transactions per escrow contract is 1000
    And an escrow contract requires to lock at least 10 "cat.currency" to guarantee that the it will conclude
    And an escrow contract is active up to 2 days
    And the mean block generation time is 15 seconds
    And Alice has at least 10 "cat.currency" in her account

  Scenario: An account creates an escrow contract
    Given Alice defined the following bonded escrow contract:
      | type           | sender   | recipient | data             |
      | send-an-asset  | Alice    | Bob       | 10 cat.currency  |
      | send-an-asset  | Sue      | Alice     | 2 euros          |
    When Alice published the bonded contract
    Then every sender participant should receive a notification to accept the contract

  Scenario: An account creates an escrow contract signed by all the participants
    Given Alice defined the following escrow contract:
      | type           | sender | recipient | data             |
      | send-an-asset  | Alice  | Bob       | 5 cat.currency   |
      | send-an-asset  | Sue    | Alice     | 2 euros          |
    And "Sue" accepted the contract
    When Alice publishes the contract
    Then every sender participant should receive a notification to accept the contract
    And the swap of assets should conclude

  Scenario: An account tries to create an escrow already signed by the participants (multisig cosignatory)
    Given Alice created a 2 of 2 multisignature contract called "Tom" with 1 required for removal with cosignatories:
      | cosignatory |
      | Computer    |
      | Phone       |
    And Alice defined the following escrow contract:
      | type           | sender | recipient | data             |
      | send-an-asset  | Alice  | Computer  | 10 cat.currency  |
      | send-an-asset  | Tom    | Sue       | 2 cat.currency   |
    And "Phone" accepted the contract
    And "Computer" accepted the contract
    When Alice publishes the contract
    And the swap of assets should conclude

  Scenario: An account tries to create an escrow already signed by the participants (mlma cosignatory)
    Given Alice created a 1 of 2 multisignature contract called "Computer" with 1 required for removal with cosignatories:
      | cosignatory |
      | Browser     |
      | App         |
    And Alice created a 1 of 2 multisignature contract called "Tom" with 1 required for removal with cosignatories:
      | cosignatory |
      | Computer    |
      | Phone       |
    And Phone defined the following escrow contract:
      | type           | sender   | recipient  | data             |
      | send-an-asset  | Computer | Alice      | 5 cat.currency   |
      | send-an-asset  | Tom      | Sue        | 2 cat.currency   |
    And "Browser" accepted the contract
    And "App" accepted the contract
    When Phone publishes the contract
    And the swap of assets should conclude

  Scenario: An account creates an escrow contract using other types of transactions
    Given Alice defined the following bonded escrow contract:
      | type                             | sender | data                      |
      | register-a-namespace             | Alice  | alice                     |
      | create-a-multisignature-contract | Bob    | 1-of-1, cosignatory:alice |
    When she publishes the contract
    Then every sender participant should receive a notification to accept the contract

  Scenario: An account creates an escrow contract and another account locks the funds for that contract
    Given Bob defined the following bonded escrow contract:
      | type                             | sender | data                      |
      | register-a-namespace             | Alice  | alice                     |
      | create-a-multisignature-contract | Bob    | 1-of-1, cosignatory:alice |
    When Alice publishes the contract
    Then every sender participant should receive a notification to accept the contract

  Scenario: An account creates an escrow contract which fails and balance of all accounts remain the same

      | send-an-asset  | Sue      | Alice     | 200 unknown      |
    And Alice published the bonded contract
    And "Sue" accepts the transaction
    When the hash lock expires
    Then Bob balance should remain intact
    And Sue balance should remain intact
    And Alice "cat.currency" balance should decrease in 10 units

  Scenario: An account creates an escrow contract where one participant have insufficient balance

      | send-an-asset  | Sue      | Alice     | 200 unknown      |

      | create-a-multisignature-contract | Bob    | 1-of-1, cosignatory:alice |
    And Alice locks 10 "cat.currency" to guarantee that the contract will conclude 1 block
    When she publishes the contract
    Then she should receive the error "FAILURE_LOCKHASH_INACTIVE_HASH"
