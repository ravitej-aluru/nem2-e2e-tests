Feature: Get balance transfers
  As Alice
  I want to know why my balance was decrease
  after registering a mosaic or a namespace

    Given the native currency asset is "cat.currency"
    And creating a namespace costs 1 cat.currency per block
    And creating a subnamespace costs 100 cat.currency
    And registering an asset costs 500 cat.currency
    And the mean block generation time is 15 seconds
    And Alice has 10000000 "cat.currency" in her account

  # Mosaic
  Scenario: Alice wants to get the cost of registering an asset
    Given Alice registered the asset "alice_token"
    When Alice checks how much cost registering the asset
    Then Alice should get that registering the asset "alice_token" cost "500" cat.currency

  # Namespace
  Scenario Outline: Alice wants to get the cost of registering a namespace
    Given Alice registers a namespace named "<name>" for <duration> block
    When she checks how much cost registering the namespace
    Then Alice should get that registering the namespace cost "<cost>" cat.currency

    Examples:
      | name  | duration | cost |
      | test1 | 6        | 6    |
      | test2 | 10       | 10   |

  Scenario Outline: Alice wants to get the cost of extending a namespace
    Given Alice registers a namespace named "token" for 6 block
    And Alice extends the registration of the namespace named "token" for <duration> block
    When she checks how much cost extending the namespace
    Then Alice should get that extending the namespace cost "<cost>" cat.currency

    Examples:
      | duration | cost |
      | 7        | 7    |
      | 9        | 9    |
